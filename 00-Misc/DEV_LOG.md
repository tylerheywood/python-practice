# Dev Log

## 2026-01-06
- Previous to this had completed AP Exception and Duplication report and engine
- Restarted focused Python practice alongside CS50
- Reflected on wanting to move beyond tutorials into real systems
- Decided to prioritise fundamentals + fluency over speed

## 2026-01-07
- Continued work on trading journal ideas
- Practised basic data handling and control flow
- Noted that building something real helps concepts stick better

## 2026-01-08
- Started thinking more deliberately about program structure
- Began separating “logic” from “output” mentally
- Realised I’m more motivated when code solves a real problem

## 2026-01-09
- began working on designing an Inbox Control System (automation & risk visibility)
- Worked on early stats-style logic (counts, totals, min/max)
- First time the “initial value sets the baseline” idea really mattered
- Caught myself wanting to default min/max to 0 — learned why that’s wrong

## 2026-01-10
- Reflected on career direction and how coding fits long-term
- Thought more seriously about GitHub as a portfolio, not just storage
- Decided to keep practice repos private for now

## 2026-01-11
- Built more confidence using while loops and sentinel values
- Started recognising recurring patterns instead of writing from scratch
- Felt momentum building

## 2026-01-12
- Practised dictionary-based state tracking
- Had to look up syntax for updating dict values
  - for reference where stats is dict name and total is the key
  - stats["total"] is used to call on that value
- Realised looking things up is normal — logic matters more than memory

## 2026-01-13
- Began refactoring code into functions
- Focused on separation of concerns (validation vs computation vs output)
- First time code started to feel “clean” rather than just correct

## 2026-01-14
- Hit a real difficulty spike with try/except and validation logic
- Spent a long time stuck but didn’t look up solutions
- Brain felt fried — but learned a lot about control flow

## 2026-01-15
- Revisited try/except with a clearer mental model
- Understood why input should stay as text until validated
- Could finally explain the logic in plain English

## 2026-01-16
- Started thinking about repo organisation and project grouping
- Cleaned up GitHub structure to reduce clutter
- Felt proud seeing things look intentional instead of messy

## 2026-01-17
- Refactored stats logic into a class (`Stats`)
- Split code into multiple files (`main.py`, `stats.py`)
- Noticed I reached for OOP naturally without forcing it

## 2026-01-18
- Completed multiple Python challenges in one day
- v1.0.0 of the inbox control system 90% complete, one more validation feature that I want to update

## 2026-01-19
- Went from globals → dict → class-based state
- Combined CS50 with hands-on Python practice
- Felt genuinely proud of progress in under a month
