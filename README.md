## Purpose

This repository tracks my Python learning through small practice projects
and selected LeetCode challenges.

The focus is on understanding, iteration, and clear reasoning rather than
solution count or speed.

My intention is to improve how I express my thought process in code and,
over time, build a toolbox of problem-solving techniques that help me
translate the logic in my head into working programs.

## Structure

- `00-Misc` — Scratch scripts and experiments.
- `01-Practice-Projects` — Small exercises focused on control flow,
  validation, refactoring, state tracking, OOP, these will gradually
become more complex over time.
- `02-LeetCode-Solutions` — Selected LeetCode challenges.
  Folder numbers correspond to the LeetCode problem number.
